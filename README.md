# Poker Preflop Guide
This Windows desktop program was made to easily navigate pre-flop play in the popular card game, No-Limit Texas Hold'em.

## Usage
This program was created using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 with C++. [Software here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/).
To run the program, download the project and run the applet executable file in the "executable" folder. Folder also contains image resources for the applet to smoothly load. 

## Features
The current program contains pre-flop charts for the following scenarios:
- Heads-Up (100 BB stacks)
  - Raise First In (RFI)
  - Facing a Raise (vs RFI)
  - Facing a 3-bet (vs 3-bet)
  - Facing a 3-bet (vs 4-bet)

Simply click the appropriate button to bring up the desired pre-flop chart. Some hands can mix their strategy. 
Use the built-in random number generator in the top-left to assist in making randomized decisions.
